   <h1>Tax Reform Could Help The Working Class. Republicans Don’t Seem Interested</h1>
    <p>
        WASHINGTON ― Republicans have said a lot about how they want to reform the tax code this year ― repealing taxes on large inheritances, cutting the number of tax brackets, and reducing tax rates for businesses.

But they haven’t said a thing about what they want to do with a tax break for working-class Americans that, as of 2015, reached more than 28 million low-income households: the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC. Unlike tax breaks that reduce the amount of taxes a person owes, the EITC actually gives people money directly.

Republicans and Democrats have repeatedly expanded this credit on a bipartisan basis since it was first created in 1975. Conceived as a ”work bonus,” the measure served as an alternative to proposals to that would have given poor families a guaranteed income. It was supposed to be temporary, but Congress has gradually increased the value of the benefits through a half-dozen pieces of legislation since then.

“Almost always, when tax reform happens, there’s some piece thrown in for low-income families,” said Elaine Maag, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute.  

But this time seems different, so far. When HuffPost asked House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) office how the EITC may factor into current tax reform proposals, press aides referred questions to the House Ways and Means Committee, the panel traditionally responsible for writing tax legislation. Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) favors maintaining ― but apparently not expanding ― the policy, according to a spokeswoman.

“Chairman Brady supports maintaining the EITC and ensuring that it is working effectively and efficiently,” Ways and Means spokeswoman Emily Schillinger said in an email.

Chuck Marr, a tax policy expert at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed out that decades of wage stagnation became a dominant theme of the 2016 presidential election. Marr said it was surprising that working-class woes have been absent from the tax discussion in Congress so far.

“They’re moving around lots of money, and for working-class people the EITC is one of the most ― if not the most ― important part of the tax code,” Marr said. “It’s also the main vehicle in the tax code to subsidize wages. It works. It’s been around for decades. There’s extensive research about how it helps encourage work.”

The EITC originally gave low-income workers a 10 percent credit for their first $4,000 of income, with that credit diminishing as earnings rose beyond that level. Congress has since boosted the maximum benefit amount and raised the cap on earnings that are counted toward the credit, especially for people with children.

A single parent with three kids who earns between $14,000 and $18,000 per year, for example, can now get as much as $6,318 back after filing a tax return. Since low-income workers tend not to have much tax liability, the vast majority receive the benefit as a check in the mail after they file their taxes.

The IRS dished out $58 billion worth of EITC checks in 2015, making the policy comparable in size to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is the second-biggest federal safety net measure after Medicaid.

The EITC lifted more than 6 million people above the poverty line in 2015, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
