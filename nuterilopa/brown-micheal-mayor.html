    <h1>The "Mayor" costars tell all on what drew them to the new ABC comedy with a political angle! Hear what the duo says they hope fans get from the show.</h1>
    <p>was it about this show that appeal to both the music aspect in us move into the political aspect of it too because you know like especially when dealing with his Pop Pop is based in that you know and so is it was very nice to do research like to just incorporate that the snows of the energy into it for me with the political aspect I'm a political junkie I'm watching TV all the time it was really great to be apart of something we can actually maybe effects and change it is a young person to watch the show and think I need to run for office I could run for office one day after seeing Brenda play Courtney so that's the political sides look at me . so what is the kind of balance between being a comedy in it being like a real show about real issues . I think when ever you have real issues that are based in reality especially in this day in age can be kind of comedic so I so that the exact easily with this is going to be so real to the point was like as pretty as can be very funny . yes yes yes I agree and what about your working relationship as mother and son because you guys are really stops you on long so it is I like for you two are together he and the you learned any really great things about each other over the boundary around her no matter it is doing press than that of his doing . go shopping today Beth and Rafe kind of reward as in the streets the essence of us we had this and I'm not even a public dance I'm having a private dance dance and we dance on bourbon Street he does have gas in the phones all day and that the I let him lead me so I think that's a good sign that I trust Him and trust him as an actor were doing scenes together though he's a safe place a person to do scenes with because he's his present . you know I mean it's it's good I think we have a good a good mother son chemistry is really been great and that's the key with that truss is so much stress on the set and we all just able to play with each other yet so excited to take long to developers and he didn't have long to get instantaneous and listen I'm etching of a few shows is not always the case where you immediately fall in love with your co star someday when I was blessed to have a community have it here . it's not easy to take different people from different parts of their life and economic whatever and put them together and and it just fits because people are interesting and weird so to find people the kind of mess with you as a blessing is that shouldn't be dealing with like real life politics or as a kind of going to be in its own little world . well it's it's great isn't it the world for Gray is a fictional town but is dealing with real life politics on Matt whipped from the headlines for saying that he won't be I don't think we'll see any any episodes about health care debate but we might see something about art in schools and we might take some of the things that happened in the healthcare debate and that is a part of our school so we're going to fight germs finding interesting ways to to be political without be hitting people over the head without being preachy but not a Republican or Democratic show there's that part of politics is not in our show people are either have a good heart out for themselves and you could get to pick and choose who the winner is .
