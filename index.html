    <article>
    <pMr. President I know you're only five days in but has it changed to add or change too much . I've had a wonderful life a wonderful success . I want to make this a great success . the American people and for the people that put me in this position so I don't want to change too much I can be the most presidential person ever . other than possibly the great Abe Lincoln . alright I can be the most presidential person but I may not be able to do the job nearly as well as I do that . your predecessor use it often about finishing the day to get to his family upstairs The stair wells right over here to have dinner with them and I know that the first lady millennia has a big job back in your taking care of us yes does it make a lonely place for you today . no because I end up working longer and that's okay . I mean I'm working long hours in the country is a lot of problems he says a lot of problems and President Trump tonight on the controversial moves he's made already . Mr. President I want to start with five easy and your campaign promises I know today you plan on signing the order to build the wall correct . are you going to direct U S funds to pay for this wall American taxpayers pay for the wall . ultimately it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico will be starting those negotiations relatively soon and we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico which at the chest back yet absolutely one hundred percent of the American taxpayer will pay for the wallet first . well it is as will be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico now I could wait a year and I could hold off the wall but I want to build the well we have to build the wall we have to stop drugs from pouring in . we have to stop people from just pouring into our country we have no idea where they're from and I campaigned on the wall and it's very important but that won't cost us nothing . when you talked often about Mexico paying for the wall and you again say they'll pay us back . Mexico's president said in recent days that Mexico absolutely will not pay adding that goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans he says was simply just a dude and he has to say he has to say that but I'm just telling you there will be a payment it will be in a form perhaps a complicated form and you have to understand what I'm going is good for the United States it's also going to be good for Mexico City some of your supporters who might say wait a minute but up next going to pay for this right at the start . well it's a very simply that they are going to pay for something a pic from the start I said Mexico will pay for the wall construction begin as soon as we can as soon as we can physically do it where the months I would say in months ya I would say My certainly planning starting immediately . I want to ask about undocumented immigrants who are here in this country right now the protected a so called dreamers children who were brought here as you know by their parents should they be worried that they could be deported . is there anything you can say to assure them right now that they'll be allowed to stay they should be very worried they are here illegally should be very worried . I do have a big heart . we're going to take care of everybody we're going to have a very strong border would have a very solid border where you have great people that are here that have done a good job they should be far less where it will be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks . Mr. President will they be allowed to stay . I'm going to tell you over the next four weeks . I want to ask you about something you said this week right here at the White House who brought in congressional leaders to the White House who spoke at length about the presidential election with them telling them that you lost the popular vote because of millions of illegal votes three to five million illegal votes that would be the biggest electoral fraud in American history . where's the evidence of that . so let me tell you first of all it was so misrepresented that was supposed to be a confidential meeting and you weren't supposed to go out and talk to the press as soon as you are but the Democrats if the unit not as a confidential but what about the millions sure what I do a number of weeks before and I mean but just say it was a bust of a confidential meeting they turned it into a knot a couple number two the conversation lasted for about a minute . they made somebody said it was like twenty five percent of the day wasn't hardly even discussed . I set it and I said it strongly because what's going on with voter fraud is horrible . that's number one number two I would've won the popular vote if I was campaigning for the populace . I was going to California where I didn't go in all I would have gone to New York why didn't campaign at all . I would have gone to a couple of places that I didn't go to and I would've won that much easier than winning the electoral college college but as you know the electoral college is all that matters it doesn't make any difference with that being said if you look at voter registration . you look at the dead people that are registered to vote who vote you look at people that are registered in two states you look at all of these different things that are happening with registration . you take a look at those registration for spite and women to do an investigation of three to five million illegal to find out but it could very well be that much you have people that are registered who are dead who are illegals who are into state's young people registered in two states The registered in New York and New Jersey they vote twice . there are millions of votes in my opinion . now the investigation from the president gave an instance when you say was I want the voting process to be legitimate but I'm asking what I mean so that when you say in your opinion . millions of illegal votes that is something that is extremely fundamental to our functioning democracy a fair and free election should use a launch an investigation has done what you are presented so far has been debunked . it's been going all psycho look at the Pew report called the author of the Pew report last night and he told me that they found no evidence of children running to write a report he said no evidence of the right then why did you write the report the Pew report the news that he's gobbling again you know I always talk about the reporters a gravel when they want to write something that you want to hear but not necessarily millions of people on here or have to hear this investigation going to launch an investigation to find out and then the next time and I will say this of those votes cast . none of them come to me none of them come to me they would all be for the other side . none of them come to me but when you look at the people that are registered dead illegal and two states and some cases maybe three states we have a lot to look into House Speaker Paul Ryan and said I have seen no evidence I mean this very very clear Senator Lindsey Graham saying it's the most inappropriate thing for President to say without proof . he seems obsessed with the idea that he could not possibly lost the popular vote without cheating and fraud . I want to ask about something bigger here . does it matter more . nothing big nothing big but is important to you know what's important . millions of people agree with me when I say that if you would have looked on one of the other networks and all of the people that were calling and saying we agree with Mr. Trump we agree the very smart people . let me just ask you did when you're the president or something that's for me right now that's true do you think that your words matter more yes very much do you think that they're talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country not our sending the matter because many people feel the same way that I do and you don't think it undermined her credibility and no not at all because they would then come to me . believe me those were Hillary votes Mr. President I just have one more question us and it's it's it's bigger picture you took some heat after your visit to the C I A in from the Howard Wall hundred seventeen stars of those lost at the C I A you talked about other things but you also talked about crowd size at the inauguration about the size of your rallies about covers on Time magazine and I just want to ask you when does all of that matter just a little less when you let it roll off your back now that you the presence of Glade us so I went to the CAA my first to have great respect for the people and intelligence in CA and I don't have a lot of respect for in particular one of the leaders but that's okay but a lot of respect for the people in the CIA that speech was a homerun that speech . if you look at Fox . okay I mention a new net we'd see what Fox said . they said was one of the great speeches they showed the people applauding and screaming and they were also helping somebody was asking Shawn where they come people that were not complete the CAA people that location was given to me Mike Pence one up before me pay great homage to the wall . I then went up pay great homage to the wall . I then spoke to the crowd got a standing ovation he would give the same speech he went back absolutely . people loved it they love that they give a standing ovation for long period of time they never even sat down most of them during the speech there was love in the room you and other networks covered it very inaccurately . I hate to say this to you and you probably won't put it on but turn on Fox and see how it was covered and see how people respond to that speech that speech was a good speech and you add a couple of other networks try to downplay that speech and was very very unfortunate that you did . I am curious about the first full day here at the White House choosing to send the press secretary out in the debris from summoning reporters to talk about the inaugural crowd size does that send a message to the American people that that's that's more important than some of the very pressing issues . part of my hole victory was that the men and women of this country who have been forgotten will never be forgotten again part of that is when they try and demean me unfairly because we had a massive crowd of people we we had a crowd . I look over that sea of people and I said to myself Wow I've seen crowds before big big crowds that was some crowd when I looked at the numbers that happened to come in from all of the various sources with the biggest audience in the history of inaugural speeches I said the men and women that I was talking to who came out and voting will never be forgotten again . therefore I won't allow you for other people like you to demean that Craddock and to demean the people that came to Washington DC from faraway places because they like me but more importantly like what I'm saying let's talk about many things have happened this week Chicago last night you tweet about the murder rate in Chicago saying if Chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage going on I will send in the feds will send an offense we mean the carnage . you know in my speech I got tremendous from certain people what carnage carnage . it's horrible carnage . this is Afghanistan is not like what's happening in Chicago . people are being shot left and right . thousands of people over a period over short period of time this year which has just started is worse than last year which was a catastrophe not doing the job . now if they want help I would love to help them . I will send in what we have to send and maybe they're not going to have to be so politically correct maybe they're being overly political correct . maybe there's something going on but you can have those killings going on in Chicago Chicago is like a war zone . Chicago is worse than some of the people that you report and some of the places that you report about every night so I will release you mentioned federal assistance . there's federal assistance and are sending in the fence I'm just curious would you take action on your own . I want them to fix the problem you can have thousands of people being shot in the city in a country that I happened to be present . maybe it's okay if somebody else is present . I want them to fix the problem the problem is very easily fixable thing to have to get tougher and stronger and smarter but they got to fix the problem . I don't want to have thousands of people shot in a city where essentially I'm the president . I love Chicago I know Chicago and Chicago is a great city can be a great city that can't be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread can't be a great city and if they are unable to fix it . that's when you will so far they have been on a bus been going on for years and I wasn't president what's going on so all I'm saying is to the mare who came up to my office recently I say you have to smart not have to toughen up because you can't let that happen that's the worst is a warning . I want them to straighten out the problem a big problem . let me ask you a new report that you are poised to lift a ban on so called C I A plaque sites prisons around the world that have been using the passes that room will be talking about that in about two hours or you live and you're going to see about two hours tonight we are still waiting for word from the Trump White House on any decision involving those so called black sites the last president President Obama said the US does not torture . will you say that . well I have in general have great respect for General Myers who shares will surprise to said he's not a believer in torture as you know this from pale was just approved affirmed by the Senate and he's a fantastic guy he's going to be the head of the CAA and you have somebody fabulous as opposed to the character that just got out walked it was not fabulous at all and He will . I think to a great job and he as you know I'm not into great detail but I will tell you I have spoken to others in intelligence and they are big believers in as an example waterboarding you could tell they say it does work does work . Mr. President personally Mr. President you told me during one of the debates that you would bring back water boarding and hell of lot worse tired busy or I would do I want to keep our country safe . I want to keep our country say what is the shooting when the chopping off the heads of our people and other people when they're chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian the Middle East when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since medieval times would I feel strongly about waterboarding as far as I'm concerned we have to fight fire with fire now with that being said I'm going with general matters . I'm going with my secretary because I think pump A O is going to be phenomenal . I'm going to go with what they say but I have spoken as recently as twenty four hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence on Aston the question Does it work . does torture work . the answer was yes absolutely you're now the president do you want waterboarding . I don't want people to chop off the citizens or anybody's heads in the Middle East okay because they're Christian or Muslim or any thing else I don't want look you are old enough to have seen a time that was much different universe who heads chopped off until a few years ago now the chapel muffin they put him on camera and send them all over the world so we have that and we're not allowed to do anything . we're not playing an even field . I will say this I will rely on pomp A O and Magnus and my group and they don't want to do that's fine if they do want to do then I will work for Dad and I want to do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally . but do I feel it works . absolutely I feel at work so you be ok well I know I want to I will rely on general matters . I've been realigned as two people and others if they don't want to do it one hundred percent okay with me . do I think it works . absolutely we head outside to the colony . we discussed what happened shortly after President Trump the oath of office . this is the famous wat u've seen so many presidents so many . let me ask you right after the oath of office they give you the nuclear coats the biscuit sobering moment when they explain what it represents and the kind of destruction that you're talking about it is a very sobering moment . yes it's very very very scary and assess keep you up and I know but it's confidence at all do the right thing in the right job but it's a very very scary thing . every president does get asked what keeps them awake . what's unsettling what has been most unsettling for you now you're five days and well I think I see tremendous amount of waste . I see a tremendous amount of job opportunities that have been let go for many years and I'm not just talking about President Obama talking about for many many years and I was a big big fan of Ronald Reagan's but I was never a big fan on trade with respect to Ronald Reagan years and years of allowing our jobs to be dissipated in this country and there's no reason for the economy keeps you up more than terrorism and and how much I do it all the same very important yup terrorism is to me number one because we have to keep people safe . most importantly we have to keep people safe but the economy is certainly I mean we have to bring the judge that I talked to a forgotten men and women are not forgotten any more because they came out voted . a lot of people you folks didn't know they existed and interests which they waited they all come from was pretty amazing lesson Mr. President I want to ask you about refugees . you're about to sign a sweeping executive action to suspend immigration to this country who are we talking about is just a muscle man we're talking about notes that the Muslim band but it's countries that have tremendous Tara and its countries that people are going to come and cause tremendous problems our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in who in many cases or in some cases are looking to do tremendous destruction we look at what's happening now have a whole list to be very thrilled you're looking at people that come and in many cases in some cases with evil intentions . I don't want their ISIS coming under false pretense . I don't want that I'm going to be the president of a safe country we have enough problems now absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries and all you have to do is take a look it's it's a disaster was happening I don't want that to happen here now with that being said President Obama and Hillary Clinton . Hamill and Carrie have allowed tens of thousands of people into our country the FBI is now investigating more people than ever before having to do with Tara and strum the group of people came and so looked like a country has a lot of problems believe me I know what the problems are even better than you do get the problems serious problems we don't need more . let me ask about some of the countries that won't be on the list Afghanistan Pakistan Saudi Arabia you're going to see you going to see what going to have extreme vetting in all cases and I mean extreme and when not letting people in if we think there's even a little chance of some problem or you are what we are excluding certain countries but for other countries were going to have extreme betting it's going to be very hard to come out right now is very easy to come and to be very very hard . I don't want air in this country you look at what happened in San Bernardino you look at what happened all of Little what happened in the World Trade Center . ok me take that as an example are you will discern the real concern is going to cause more anger among Muslims around the world is plenty of anger right now . how can you have more exacerbated prob David I mean I know you're a sophisticated guy the world is a mess the world is angry she gets when you think this is going to cause a little more anger the world is an angry place all of this has happened . we went into Iraq we should guide to a rack . we should have gotten out the way we got out the world is a total mess the world has amassed and you brought up Iraq and something you said that could affect American troops in recent days who said we should have kept the oil but okay maybe we'll have another chance with the mother . well we should cap the well we got out and you know it's very interesting had we taken the way you would have ISIS because they feel themselves with the oil that's when I got to my So you believe we can go in take the oil we should have taken the oil . you wouldn't have ISIS . we took the lead for the critics who say that would break all international law taking the oil but I want to get to the words to say that women can you believe who the critics who say that fools call them critics I called and let me talk about you should've kept his body . we should have taken the luau and we took the oil you would have ISIS and we would have had wealth we have spent right now . six trillion dollars in the Middle East and our country is falling apart . what caught my attention Mr. President was when you said maybe we'll have another chance . well don't get your attention too much because we'll see what happens and we were going to see what happens you know I told you I told everybody else that wants to talk when it comes to the military . I don't want to discuss things I want to let I want to let the action take place before the talk takes place . I watched in Mosul when a number of months ago generals and politicians would get up and say we're going in to muzzle in four months then they'd say We're going in three months two months once were going in next week . okay I kept saying to myself Gee why do they have to keep talking about going in . alright so now they go and it is tough because they've given the enemy all this time to prepare . I want to do a lot of talk in the military . I want to talk after it's finished . not before it starts the eye .</p>
