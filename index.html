    <article>
        <p>Mr. President I know you're only five days in but has it changed to add or change too much . I've had a wonderful life a wonderful success . I want to make this a great success . the American people and for the people that put me in this position so I don't want to change too much I can be the most presidential person ever . other than possibly the great Abe Lincoln . alright I can be the most presidential person but I may not be able to do the job nearly as well as I do that . your predecessor use it often about finishing the day to get to his family upstairs The stair wells right over here to have dinner with them and I know that the first lady millennia has a big job back in your taking care of us yes does it make a lonely place for you today . no because I end up working longer and that's okay . I mean I'm working long hours in the country is a lot of problems he says a lot of problems and President Trump tonight on the controversial moves he's made already . Mr. President I want to start with five easy and your campaign promises I know today you plan on signing the order to build the wall correct . are you going to direct U S funds to pay for this wall American taxpayers pay for the wall . ultimately it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico will be starting those negotiations relatively soon and we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico which at the chest back yet absolutely one hundred percent of the American taxpayer will pay for the wallet first . well it is as will be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico now I could wait a year and I could hold off the wall but I want to build the well we have to build the wall we have to stop drugs from pouring in . we have to stop people from just pouring into our country we have no idea where they're from and I campaigned on the wall and it's very important but that won't cost us nothing . when you talked often about Mexico paying for the wall and you again say they'll pay us back . Mexico's president said in recent days that Mexico absolutely will not pay adding that goes against our dignity as a country and our dignity as Mexicans he says was simply just a dude and he has to say he has to say that but I'm just telling you there will be a payment it will be in a form perhaps a complicated form and you have to understand what I'm going is good for the United States it's also going to be good for Mexico City some of your supporters who might say wait a minute but up next going to pay for this right at the start . well it's a very simply that they are going to pay for something a pic from the start I said Mexico will pay for the wall construction begin as soon as we can as soon as we can physically do it where the months I would say in months ya I would say My certainly planning starting immediately . I want to ask about undocumented immigrants who are here in this country right now the protected a so called dreamers children who were brought here as you know by their parents should they be worried that they could be deported . is there anything you can say to assure them right now that they'll be allowed to stay they should be very worried they are her </p>
