    <p>Jimmy Kimmel breaks down in tears over the mass shooting in his hometown of Las Vegas . this is just a regular part of our lives now . during Monday's Jimmy Kimmel Live monologue the late night host was visibly distraught over the tragic shooting that left fifty nine dead in over five hundred injured at the Route ninety one Country Music Festival on Sunday . here we are again in the aftermath of another terrible inexplicable shocking and painful tragedy this time in Las Vegas which happens to be my hometown this morning we get children without parents and fathers and sons mothers without ordered the last two police officers we lost a nurse . Jimmy also addressed gun control in the need for Americans to stand up and make a change . it's a public safety issue and something needs to be done already so tell your congress people to do something . I mean it's not enough the singer love and prayers and do we send our love and support and whatever else is needed to Las Vegas and do the families from all over the country and later country singer Luke Holmes who performed at Route ninety one prior to the attack to the Jimmy Kimmel Live stage to honor the last biggest victims The God of all is .</p>
