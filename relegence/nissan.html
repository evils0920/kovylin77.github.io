    <h1>Nissan Motor Company plans to recall 1.2 million cars in Japan after it discovered final vehicle inspections were not perfromed by authorised technicians. Sonia Legg reports</h1>
    <p>News that tens of thousands of vehicles were produced without proper safety checks sent Nissan's share price down over five percent to a five month low. Then it got worse. After Asia markets closed Japan's second largest automaker announced a recall of 1.1 million cars in its home market, which would cost the company $200 million The problems began late on Friday when Nissan announced vehicles made at home had been checked by unauthorised technicians. At first it was just a case of rechecking all new vehicles - then came the update. 21 models, including the electric Leaf are affected. Nissan made 386,000 vehicles for the Japanese market in 2016. It has to register all of them with Japan's government before sale. An internal investigation will now be carried out - with third party participation. Nissan hopes to find out what went wrong within around a month.</p>
