    <h1>Officials are investigating what appears to be an accidental shooting at the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park. The park`s president, Joe Exotic, was killed.</h1>
    <p>first I'd like to thank everybody for coming today so I can set the record straight for Joe Maldonado more commonly known as Joe exotic Friday was the worst day of his life . I was in town run some errands and I received a large stone column I live and that was my husband was shot and killed at the zoo with his own gun and a tragic accident because he thought the semiautomatic forty five would not go off without the clip it has been to four years Travis mom's not a lid on the property with Joe the last words that we had before I left for town bought him a twenty three dollars to him and pull the lace women in Islam when I left and wise words of Berlin's I Love You but he says what happened in the parks office was no suicide and I just want the world to know that whatever you hear on the news or other social media he did not kill himself intentionally . he loved life more than you can ever imagine . carbon County officials are investigating the incident to say the manner of death appears to be a gunshot wound to the head . the incident happened in front of other employees will the park was open . Joe says his twenty three year old husband was adventurous and live to make him smile and he was passionate about his hobby and I'm sure that you know let it get in get out they probably had a pipe a little bit a lead in his pocket because that's where he lived for was his guns his dog and his right to smoke marijuana in love Amy Jo is not thinking the world for the support and he says he will continue to be inspired by his late husband he wanted so much to support me in my political career running for governor state of Oklahoma because he only said hi and if anybody can get the people in the state to love and respect each other it would be you . news , us news Democratic Party, KILL, Love, Oklahoma, United States, Texas</p>
