    <h1>The board of Harvey Weinstein's company fires him as allegations pile up of sexual harassment going back decades. Eve Johnson reports.</h1>
    <p>One of Hollywood's biggest power brokers is out of a job. Harvey Weinstein fired from his own company on Sunday (October 8) as allegations of sexual abuse pile up around him following an expose in the New York Times. The 65 year-old movie exec had earlier taken a leave of absence. But the board of Weinstein Company made the decision to fire him "in light of new information about misconduct...that has emerged in the past few days." His departure leaves his brother Bob and COO David Glasser in charge. Weinstein helped make movies like "Shakespeare in Love" and "Chicago." He is also a big backer of liberal causes and donated to Democrats during the 2016 election. The company says it's running its own internal investigation after the Times reported Weinstein had settled with at least eight women who accused him of sexual harassment going back decades.
