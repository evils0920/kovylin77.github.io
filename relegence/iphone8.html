    <h1>A new case of Apple's new iPhone 8 Plus popping open due to a swollen battery has been reported in state media in China. Fred Katayama reports.</h1>
    <p>Another case of iPhone 8 Plus with bloated batteries in Asia. Chinese state media reported about a person who bought an iPhone 8 Plus through a Chinese online retailer JD.com, and that phone arrived cracked open. There was no sign of scorching or an explosion. The owner said he did not charge the new device. He returned it to the seller. An Apple spokesperson said the company is looking into the matter but declined to comment further. Loup Ventures' Gene Munster: (SOUNDBITE) GENE MUNSTER, MANAGING PARTNER, LOUP VENTURES (ENGLISH) SAYING: "I think this is just part of natural progression when a new product launches. It just makes a terrible headline, but, ultimately, it's something that I don't think is gonna be an issue." China is the world's largest market for smartphones. The incident comes as Apple investigates similar cases reported in Taiwan and Japan.</p>
